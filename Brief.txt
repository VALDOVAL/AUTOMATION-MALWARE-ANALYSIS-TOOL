Although many tools exist to extract  information from malware files, these tools are not connected and so much of the burden is placed on the analyst to examine the data in different formats and draw conclusions as to what the nature of the file is.
The aim of this project is to design a tool that would gather data from static and dynamic tools and centralise it into a single format. The idea would be only to gather data from the tools that would be considered of interest ( I e malicious code, actions behaviours etc.) Centralising data in this way would give the examiner all of the information needed to conduct an investigation on the sample. The data would then be transformed into a report-style file.
Deliverables:
•	Compile relevant data extracted through various malware analysis tools
•	Design and develop a tool to centralise the data into a single format
•	Produce an easily readable report from the data.
